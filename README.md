## General Information
- Project Overview: This project involves analyzing loan data to identify patterns and factors that indicate a higher risk of loan default. By exploring various features like loan amount, interest rates, employment length, and credit history, the project aims to help financial institutions make informed decisions when assessing loan applicants.
- Background: Loan default is a critical issue for financial institutions, as it can lead to significant financial losses. Understanding the factors that contribute to loan default can help in mitigating risks by refining the loan approval process.
- Business Problem: The project seeks to solve the problem of identifying high-risk loan applicants who are likely to default. By analyzing past data, we can develop insights that aid in minimizing the default rate.
- The dataset used for this analysis includes historical loan data with variables such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, credit history, and the loan outcome (whether it was fully paid or charged off).


## Conclusions
- Higher interest rates are strongly correlated with an increased likelihood of loan default, indicating that applicants with higher interest rates should be scrutinized more closely.
- Employment length plays a significant role in default risk, with shorter employment lengths correlating with higher default rates.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
